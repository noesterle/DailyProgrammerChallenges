Your dog just won X place in a dog show, congratulations! You post your star's photo and placement announcement to /r/aww and, predictably, a funny redditor asks what places the rest of the participating dogs took. Your job is to create a program that lists all places within the range of 0-100 in spoken English, excluding the placing (X) of your winning pup. 

Bonus Challenges:
Bonus 1) Allow scaling greater than 100 placings

Bonus 2) Exclude 0th place

Bonus 3) Accurately represent the unique cases 11, 12, and 13
