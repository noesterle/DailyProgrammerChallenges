#Typoglycemia

This program takes advantage of the fact that the human brain can read almost any word as long as the first and last letters of the word are in the correct spot.

When run, it asks you to enter a string. It'll then scramble the letters of each word, except for the first and last letters. Location of punctuation is preserved.
